# Original (non-working code):

# def dog
#   return name
# end

# def cat(name)
#   return name
# end

# puts "The dog's name is #{dog('Spot')}."
# puts "The cat's name is #{cat}."


# FIXED code:

def dog(name)
  return name
end

def cat(name)
  return name
end

puts "The dog's name is #{dog('Spot')}."
puts "The cat's name is #{cat('Ginger')}."
