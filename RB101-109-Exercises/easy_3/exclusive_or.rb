# RB101-109 Small Problems
# Easy 3, Question 6 - Exclusive Or
# https://launchschool.com/exercises/d24fe972
#
# The || operator returns a truthy value if either or both of its 
# operands are truthy, a falsey value if both operands are falsey. 
# The && operator returns a truthy value if both of its operands are 
# truthy, and a falsey value if either operand is falsey. This works 
# great until you need only one of two conditions to be truthy, the 
# so-called exclusive or.
#
# In this exercise, you will write a function named xor that takes 
# two arguments, and returns true if exactly one of its arguments is 
# truthy, false otherwise. Note that we are looking for a boolean
# result instead of a truthy/falsy value as returned by || and &&.

def xor? (a, b)
  !! ((a && !b) || (!a && b))
end

p xor?(5.even?, 4.even?) == true
p xor?(5.odd?, 4.odd?) == true
p xor?(5.odd?, 4.even?) == false
p xor?(5.even?, 4.odd?) == false
